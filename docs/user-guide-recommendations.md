## Using the Recommendation System

### 1. Getting Basic Recommendations

**API Endpoint**: `GET /recommendations`

**Web Interface**: Navigate to "My Recommendations" in your dashboard

The system will automatically generate recommendations based on your current profile. Default settings provide 10 recommendations with diversity across specializations.

### 2. Customizing Recommendations

You can customize recommendations using these parameters:

#### Limit Results

\`\`\`
GET /recommendations?limit=5
\`\`\`

- **Range**: 1-20 recommendations
- **Default**: 10 recommendations
- **Tip**: Use fewer results for focused exploration, more for comprehensive options

#### Filter by Specialization

\`\`\`
GET /recommendations?includeSpecializations=AI,WebDev
GET /recommendations?excludeSpecializations=Hardware
\`\`\`

- **Include**: Only show specific specializations
- **Exclude**: Hide certain specializations
- **Available**: AI, WebDev, Mobile, DataScience, Cybersecurity, Hardware, etc.

#### Set Difficulty Level

\`\`\`
GET /recommendations?maxDifficulty=intermediate
\`\`\`

- **Levels**: beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert

#### Minimum Quality Threshold

\`\`\`
GET /recommendations?minSimilarityScore=0.7
\`\`\`

- **Range**: 0.0-1.0 (0-100%)
- **Default**: 0.3 (30%)
- **Tip**: Higher thresholds give fewer but better matches

#### Diversity Control

\`\`\`
GET /recommendations?includeDiversityBoost=false
\`\`\`

- **Default**: true (includes diverse specializations)

## Understanding AI Explanations

### How the AI Works

The recommendation system uses several AI techniques:

1. **Semantic Similarity**: Analyzes the meaning of text in your profile and project descriptions
2. **Skill Matching**: Compares your technical skills with project requirements
3. **Interest Alignment**: Matches your stated interests with project themes
4. **Specialization Fit**: Considers your academic specialization preferences
5. **Diversity Boost**: Ensures recommendations span multiple areas to prevent tunnel vision

### Explanation Components

#### Skill Analysis

- **Matching Skills**: Skills you have that the project needs
- **Skill Gaps**: Skills the project requires that you could learn
- **Skill Overlap**: Percentage of required skills you already possess
- **Learning Opportunities**: New skills you would develop

#### Interest Alignment

- **Direct Matches**: Your interests that directly relate to the project
- **Related Areas**: Adjacent interests that connect to the project
- **Interest Score**: How well the project matches your interest profile
- **Exploration Potential**: New areas you might find interesting

#### Career Relevance

- **Industry Connections**: How the project relates to your career goals
- **Skill Development**: Professional skills you would gain
- **Portfolio Value**: How the project would enhance your portfolio
