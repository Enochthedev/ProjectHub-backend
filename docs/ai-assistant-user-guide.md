## Getting Started

### What is the AI Assistant?

The AI Assistant is an intelligent Q&A system designed specifically for Final Year Project (FYP) students. It provides instant, contextual guidance on research methodologies, academic writing, project planning, and technical implementation using advanced natural language processing.

### Key Features

- **Instant Responses**: Get immediate answers to your FYP-related questions
- **Contextual Understanding**: The AI understands your project context and provides relevant guidance
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context across multiple questions in a conversation
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Access to comprehensive FYP guidelines and best practices
- **Multilingual Support**: Ask questions in multiple languages
- **Supervisor Integration**: Your supervisor can monitor your interactions and provide additional support

### Accessing the AI Assistant

1. **Login**: Use your student credentials to access the FYP platform
2. **Navigate**: Go to the "AI Assistant" section in the main menu
3. **Start**: Click "New Conversation" or continue an existing conversation

## Understanding the AI Assistant

### How It Works

The AI Assistant uses advanced language models trained on academic content and FYP guidelines. When you ask a question:

1. **Processing**: Your question is analyzed for intent and context
2. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Relevant information is retrieved from the knowledge base
3. **Response Generation**: An intelligent response is generated using AI models
4. **Quality Assessment**: The response is evaluated for confidence and accuracy
5. **Delivery**: You receive the response with confidence scores and sources

### Response Types

#### High Confidence Responses (80%+)

- Direct, comprehensive answers
- Multiple sources cited
- Detailed explanations and examples
- Follow-up suggestions provided

#### Medium Confidence Responses (50-80%)

- Good answers with some uncertainty
- Fewer sources available
- May suggest additional resources
- Encourages verification with supervisor

#### Low Confidence Responses (<50%)

- Template-based fallback responses
- Suggests human consultation
- Provides general guidance
- Offers alternative resources

### Confidence Scores

Each AI response includes a confidence score (0-100%) indicating how certain the system is about the answer:

- **90-100%**: Highly reliable, comprehensive answer
- **70-89%**: Good answer, minor uncertainty
- **50-69%**: Reasonable answer, verify if critical
- **30-49%**: Limited confidence, seek additional sources
- **0-29%**: Low confidence, consult supervisor

## Asking Effective Questions

### Question Formulation Best Practices

#### 1. Be Specific and Clear

**❌ Poor Example:**
"How do I do research?"

**✅ Good Example:**
"How do I conduct a systematic literature review for my computer science project on machine learning algorithms?"

#### 2. Provide Context

**❌ Poor Example:**
"What methodology should I use?"

**✅ Good Example:**
"I'm working on a project about user experience in mobile apps. I want to understand how users interact with different interface designs. What research methodology would be most appropriate?"

#### 3. Use Proper Academic Terminology

**❌ Poor Example:**
"How do I write the part about other people's work?"

**✅ Good Example:**
"How do I structure the literature review section of my dissertation?"

#### 4. Ask One Question at a Time

**❌ Poor Example:**
"How do I write a literature review and what's the difference between qualitative and quantitative research and how do I choose participants?"

**✅ Good Example:**
"How do I write an effective literature review for my FYP?"
(Then ask follow-up questions about methodology and participants)

### Question Categories and Examples

#### Research Methodology

- "What's the difference between qualitative and quantitative research methods?"
- "How do I choose the right sample size for my survey?"
- "What are the steps in conducting a case study?"

#### Academic Writing

- "How do I structure my dissertation chapters?"
- "What's the proper format for citing sources in APA style?"
- "How do I write a compelling research proposal?"

#### Project Planning

- "How do I create a realistic timeline for my FYP?"
- "What milestones should I set for my project?"
- "How do I manage scope creep in my research?"

#### Technical Implementation

- "What programming languages are best for machine learning projects?"
- "How do I validate my software system?"
- "What testing strategies should I use for my application?"

#### Data Analysis

- "Which statistical test should I use for my data?"
- "How do I analyze qualitative interview data?"
- "What tools are available for data visualization?"

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Getting Generic Responses

**Problem**: AI provides vague, general answers

**Solutions**:

- Add more specific details to your question
- Provide context about your project and field
- Break complex questions into smaller parts
- Use technical terminology when appropriate

**Example Fix**:

- Before: "How do I analyze data?"
- After: "How do I perform thematic analysis on qualitative interview data from 15 participants in my UX research study?"

### Issue 2: Low Confidence Scores

**Problem**: AI responses have confidence scores below 50%

**Solutions**:

- Rephrase your question more clearly
- Check if the topic is covered in the knowledge base
- Consider if the question is too specialized for AI
- Consult your supervisor for complex academic questions

### Issue 3: Irrelevant Responses

**Problem**: AI doesn't understand your question correctly

**Solutions**:

- Use more specific academic terminology
- Provide additional context about your project
- Try rephrasing the question differently
- Check for typos or unclear wording

### Issue 4: System Unavailable

**Problem**: AI Assistant is temporarily down

**Solutions**:

- Check the system status page
- Try again after a few minutes
- Use the knowledge base search as an alternative
- Contact your supervisor for urgent questions

### Issue 5: Rate Limit Reached

**Problem**: Too many questions in a short time

**Solutions**:

- Wait for the rate limit to reset (usually 1 hour)
- Use bookmarked responses to review previous answers
- Plan your questions more strategically
- Contact support if you need a higher limit

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Usage

**Q: How many questions can I ask per day?**
A: Students can ask up to 100 questions per hour. This limit resets every hour and should be sufficient for normal usage.

**Q: Can I use the AI Assistant for other subjects besides my FYP?**
A: The AI Assistant is specifically designed for FYP support. While it may help with general academic questions, it's optimized for research project guidance.

**Q: Is my conversation data private?**
A: Your conversations are private by default. Supervisors can only access your interactions if you grant permission or if conversations are escalated for help.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why do some responses take longer than others?**
A: Complex questions require more processing time. The AI may need to search multiple sources and generate more detailed responses.

**Q: Can I edit or delete my questions after asking?**
A: You cannot edit questions after sending, but you can delete entire conversations. Individual messages cannot be deleted for audit purposes.

**Q: What happens if the AI gives incorrect information?**
A: Always verify important information with academic sources. Rate incorrect responses poorly and consult your supervisor for critical guidance.

### Academic Support

**Q: Should I cite the AI Assistant in my dissertation?**
A: Follow your institution's guidelines on AI tool citation. Generally, acknowledge AI assistance in your methodology or acknowledgments section.

**Q: Can the AI Assistant help with specific software or tools?**
A: Yes, it can provide guidance on common research tools, statistical software, and programming languages used in academic projects.

**Q: What if my question is too specialized for the AI?**
A: The AI will indicate low confidence for highly specialized questions. In these cases, consult subject matter experts, supervisors, or specialized resources.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: Why can't I access certain features?**
A: Some features may be restricted based on your user role or institution settings. Contact your IT support or supervisor for access issues.

**Q: The AI doesn't understand my field-specific terminology. What should I do?**
A: Provide definitions or context for specialized terms, or use more general academic language that the AI can understand.

**Q: How do I report bugs or suggest improvements?**
A: Use the feedback form in the AI Assistant interface or contact technical support through the help desk.
