- **Dependencies**: Consider what must be completed before starting
- **Flexibility**: Allow buffer time for unexpected challenges

### Time Management

**Deadline Setting**

- Work backward from project deadline to set milestone dates
- Consider academic calendar (exams, holidays, other coursework)
- Build in buffer time for revisions and unexpected issues
- Align with supervisor availability for feedback

**Workload Distribution**

- Avoid clustering multiple deadlines in the same week
- Balance high-effort milestones with lighter tasks
- Consider your other academic and personal commitments
- Plan for periods of reduced availability (exams, holidays)

### Progress Monitoring

**Regular Reviews**

- Review milestone progress weekly
- Update status and add notes consistently
- Adjust timelines when necessary
- Communicate changes to supervisors promptly

**Early Warning Signs**

- Multiple overdue milestones
- Frequent blocking issues
- Consistently underestimating time requirements
- Lack of progress notes or updates

### Quality Assurance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem: Milestone appears overdue but work is complete**

- **Solution**: Update milestone status to "Completed" and record actual completion date
- **Prevention**: Update status immediately when work is finished

**Problem: Cannot change milestone status**

- **Possible Causes**:
  - Invalid status transition (check transition rules)
  - Missing required information (blocking reason for blocked status)
  - Permission issues (can only update your own milestones)
- **Solution**: Verify you're following status transition rules and providing all required information

**Problem: Milestone reminders not being received**

- **Check**: Email notification preferences in your profile settings
- **Verify**: Email address is correct and verified
- **Solution**: Contact system administrator if settings are correct but reminders aren't arriving

**Problem: Template application fails**

- **Common Causes**:
  - Start date is in the past
  - Generated milestones conflict with existing ones
  - Template is no longer active
- **Solution**: Choose a future start date and resolve any scheduling conflicts

**Problem: Progress calculation seems incorrect**

- **Understanding**: Progress is calculated based on milestone status, not time spent
- **Check**: Ensure all milestone statuses are up to date
- **Note**: Cancelled milestones don't count toward progress
